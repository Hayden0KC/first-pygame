Learning to create a PyGame from the ground up.

This is my first attempt at using PyGame and Tiled to create a 2D, simple, arcade-type game. Please understand that my organization might not be where it should be, my methods may not be meta, and so on. Thank you for your patience with how cluttered it may seem.
